# Steganography
This project is used to hide the text data under the images to prevent the data hacking .This is mainly used in securing the secret mesages.
The code is written in c language and this can be run in borland c.In this we are using !LSB and 2LSB technique instead of MSB technology.Because when are changing the LSB bits then there is a little difference.
The images are saved as raw files.
